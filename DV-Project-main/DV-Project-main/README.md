# Data Visualization Project

## Goal
Our project aims to create a website/dashboard containing the live statistics of all the teams in
the premier division of Spanish Soccer (Known as La Liga) that provides a comparative assessment
of each team's current standing. Through the dashboard, we intend to visualize the
measurements that are usually considered for indicating teamsâ€™ performance. Some examples
of this could be Team Form and Team Rating.
